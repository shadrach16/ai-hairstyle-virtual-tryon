Project Summary
The AI Hair Studio is an innovative web application that enables users to visualize authentic African hairstyles on their own photos using advanced AI technology. Operating on a freemium model, users can upload selfies, explore a diverse gallery of hairstyles, and generate AI-enhanced images. The business model includes free trials, credit packs, and subscription plans to enhance user engagement and monetization. The backend is built with Node.js and MongoDB, utilizing Replicate for hairstyle generation and Paystack for payment processing. Recent updates have improved user analytics features for insights into hairstyle generations and payment history.
